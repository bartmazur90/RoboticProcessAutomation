## Documentation

### Image recognition based automations
Based on well-known *PyAutoGui* lib. <br />
Ready to use functionalities, with a lot of additional parameters. <br />
Predefined with values, evaluated by me as good starting point for most cases.

* #### click_img
```
# IT WOULD TRY TO CLICK 3-TIMES, 100pixels to the right from center of an image:
rpa.click_img('path/image1.png', off_x=100, target_retries=3)
```
 <font size="2">
 <strong>target</strong>: (str) - path to the img. <br />
**target_region**: (tuple) - img region rectangle in [pixels] (x,y,width,height) <br />
**target_confidence**: (float) - treshold for img recognition, 0.01 - ultra low 0.99 - high <br />
**target_retries**: (int) - how many retries would be performed for click img <br />
**click_type**: (str) - supported ones: single,double,right <br />
**off_x**: (int) - x axis offset applied to click action, from center of the target img  <br />
**off_y**: (int) - y axis offset applied to click action, from center of the target img  <br />
**mode**: (str) - F -> return False  <br />
              E -> return Exception /default/ <br />
**wait_before_retry**: (int) - how long it would wait until each retry. <br />
**click_before_retry**: (tuple) - (x,y) to focus before retry <br />
